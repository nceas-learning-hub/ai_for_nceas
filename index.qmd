## AI for NCEAS

This set of informal interactive workshop sessions has been adapted from [NCEAS coreR course](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/learning-hub/core-r), in line with the NCEAS 2025 theme of AI for the Planet.  In these sessions, we will explore uses of generative artificial intelligence (genAI or simply AI) such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to help support NCEAS residents and others in applying AI tools to research, analysis, and writing.  We are by no means experts in the design and application of AI, we are just curious and excited (perhaps a bit apprehensive) about the possibilities these new tools offer.  We expect these sessions may eventually become formal modules in various NCEAS Learning Hub courses, but for now we just want to encourage the NCEAS community to explore the benefits and pitfalls these tools offer.


## NCEAS Expertise

The [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/), a research affiliate of UCSB, is a leading expert on interdisciplinary data science and works collaboratively to answer the world's largest and most complex questions. The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called [synthesis science](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/our-approach).

NCEAS has 30 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals.  In conjunction with the NCEAS Learning Hub, we are excited to pass along skills, workflows, and mindsets to help the NCEAS community better understand the implications of AI for the Planet.
