## Background: Limitations of Traditional Literature Reviews

Traditional literature reviews, while rigorous, often face several challenges:

- **Information overload**: The sheer volume of potentially relevant papers can be overwhelming, making it hard to prioritize.  
- **Limited scope**: Searches focused only on personal subscriptions or familiar journals may miss important interdisciplinary work (though Google Scholar helps broaden this).  
- **Citation chasing limitations**: Following references manually makes it hard to see large-scale relationships and influential clusters.  
- **Time constraints**: Researchers often lack sufficient time to systematically screen, read, and synthesize a vast literature base.  
- **Summarization bottlenecks**: Even with enough time, distilling and synthesizing findings from a high volume of papers is cognitively demanding and prone to errors or oversights.

## How to use it?

### Scenario 1: I have a specific research question and want targeted answers

  - **Elicit**: helps you find and summarize studies that directly address your question  
  - **SciSpace**: lets you upload papers and ask questions about their content  
  - **Semantic Scholar**: supports semantic keyword queries to refine answers  

---

### Scenario 2: I want to broadly discover the most influential papers in my field

  - **Semantic Scholar**: ideal for exploring influential papers by citation counts, influential authors, and topic clusters  

---

### Scenario 3: I have a list of citations in Zotero and want to explore related literature

  - **Research Rabbit**: Integrates directly with Zotero collections, helps visualize related works and authors  

---

### Scenario 4: I have a folder of PDF articles and want to ask questions about them

- **Recommended tools**:  
  - **SciSpace**: Upload PDFs and use the AI Copilot to ask questions  
  - **Google NotebookLM**: Upload multiple documents and explore connections, notes, and summaries  

---

### Scenario 5: I want to stay organized and link notes and documents with an AI assistant

- **Recommended tool**:  
  - **Google NotebookLM**: Best for organizing your own documents and exploring them with AI queries  


## Let's give it a try
::: {.callout-exercise}
 - Register one literature review tool of your choice
 - Provide 1–2 sample research questions
 - Let's talk about the results:
   - how many results were returned?
   - how relevant were the results?
   - how easy was the interface?

## Ethical Considerations

AI-powered literature review tools can be powerful, but users should be aware of potential ethical challenges, including:

- **Hallucinations**: AI models can sometimes generate or cite incorrect information.
- **Bias**: Results may reflect biases present in the training data or prioritization algorithms.
- **Data privacy**: Uploaded documents might be processed in ways that store or analyze sensitive information.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Best Practices

- **Verify sources**: Double-check references and original papers.
- **Do not copy uncritically**: Use AI tools as a *support*, not a replacement for critical thinking.
- **Cross-check**: Compare results from multiple tools to gain a balanced perspective.
- **Cite appropriately**: Follow academic integrity guidelines when summarizing AI-assisted outputs.
